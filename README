An attempt at making a toy proof checker for experimental purposes

This program encodes the type system TS developed in the paper "A universe
polymorphic type system", by Vladimir Voevodsky, the version dated October,
2012, and attempts to make a toy prototype proof assistant based on it.

Thanks to:

    Vladimir Voevodsky                  for TS and Univalence

    Andrej Bauer                        for advice about coding and
				        suggesting Logical Frameworks (LF) as the
				        way to go

    Bob Harper and Dan Licata           for explaining LF in an intuitive way

    Bob Harper and Christopher Stone    for the type checking algorithms used here
