an attempt at making a toy proof checker for experimental purposes


    BTW already the eta for Empty which has the form:

    a. (Gamma |- a:Empty , Gamma |- T : Type, Gamma |- T' : Type) => (Gamma |- T=T')

    b. (Gamma |- a:Empty , Gamma |- o : T , Gamma |- o' : T) => (Gamma |- o = o' : T)

    implies that definitional equality is undecidable. So we can add this to TS0 and start figuring out how to work with def. equality in this case. 

    We have also have in this system the following:

    1. The list of universe variables automatically contains uuu0 which is automatically <= to all other universe variables.

    2. (Gamma ok)=>(Gamma |- empty : [U](uuu0))

    3. (Gamma ok)=>(Gamma |- Empty : Type)

    4. (Gamma ok)=>(Gamma |- * empty = Empty)
