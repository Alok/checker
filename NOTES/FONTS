There's a problem on my screen with the width of the subscripted numerals.
They're 20% too wide:

    MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
    MMMMMMMMMM₁₁₁₁₁₁₁₁MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
    MM₁₁₁₁MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM₁₁₁₁MMMMMMMM
    MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

C-H C-P gives this advice about that:

    *** Some of the fonts called for in your fontset may not exist on your
    X server.

    Each X11 font covers just a fraction of the characters that Emacs
    supports.  To display the whole range of Emacs characters requires
    many different fonts, collected into a fontset.  You can remedy the
    problem by installing additional fonts.

    The intlfonts distribution includes a full spectrum of fonts that can
    display all the characters Emacs supports.  The etl-unicode collection
    of fonts (available from <URL:ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/fonts/> and
    <URL:ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/mirror/X.Org/contrib/fonts/>) includes
    fonts that can display many Unicode characters; they can also be used
    by ps-print and ps-mule to print Unicode characters.

    ** Under X11, some characters appear improperly aligned in their lines.

    You may have bad X11 fonts; try installing the intlfonts distribution
    or the etl-unicode collection (see above).
