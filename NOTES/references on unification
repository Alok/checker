     This paper is by the Matita group.

from Matthie Sozeau:

    You can have a look at Claudio Sacerdoti Coen’s thesis, chapter 10, which
    is the best reference I know on unification for CIC and Abel and Pientka’s
    paper on dynamic pattern unification for some of the tricks used in Coq
    (although their system is slightly different). Ziliani’s ICFP paper with
    Gonthier also includes some detailed explanations about unification in Coq.
