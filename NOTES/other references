Abella

	http://abella.cs.umn.edu/

	Abella is an interactive theorem prover based on lambda-tree
	syntax. This means that Abella is well-suited for reasoning about the
	meta-theory of programming languages and other logical systems which
	manipulate objects with binding.

POPLmark Challenge

	http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~plclub/poplmark/

	The POPLmark Challenge is a concrete set of benchmarks intended both for
	measuring progress and for stimulating discussion and collaboration in
	mechanizing the metatheory of programming languages.

	A Tutorial Implementation of a Dependently Typed Lambda Calculus

	Andres LÃ¶h, Conor McBride and Wouter Swierstra

	We present the type rules for a dependently-typed core calculus together with a
	straightforward implementation in Haskell. We explicitly highlight the changes
	necessary to shift from a simply-typed lambda calculus to the dependently-typed
	lambda calculus. We also describe how to extend our core language with data
	types and write several small example programs. The paper is accompanied by an
	executable interpreter and example code that allows immediate experimentation
	with the system we describe.

	MODEL STRUCTURES FROM HIGHER INDUCTIVE TYPES
	PETER LEFANU LUMSDAINE

	Abstract. We show that for any dependent type theory with Martin-Lof
	identity types and mapping cylinders (dened as certain higher-dimensional
	inductive types), the category of contexts carries a pre-model-structure, i.e.
	a model structure minus the completeness conditions. The (trivial cobra-
	tions,brations) are the Gambino-Garner weak factorisation system of [GG08],
	while the weak equivalences are equivalences in the sense of Voevodsky [Voe].
	It follows that any categorical model of this type theory carries a pre-model-
	structure, and so, if it is additionally complete and co-complete, is a model
	category.
