# We define the type of "derivations" of "judgments" inductively by
# constructors called "rules" whose parameters, written in a formal language,
# involve meta-variables at a "higher level" representing the contexts,
# u-levels, t-expressions, and o-expressions of TS.
# 
# For example, consider the following rule:
# 
# 	  G |- o : T         G |- T = T'
# 	--------------------------------- tcast (rule 13 in the paper UPTS)
# 		   G |- o : T'
#
# We incorporate the ideas of LF, allowing us to keep the context in the background,
# or, more precisely, in the parent type theory of LF.
#
# 
# 	  o : T         T = T'
# 	--------------------------------- tcast (rule 13 in the paper UPTS)
# 		   o : T'
#
#
# Let TT' denote a given derivation of T = T', and let oT denote a given
# derivation of o : T.  Then we may denote the derivation oT' of o : T'
# resulting from application of the rule as
# 
# 	  	tcast oT TT'.
# 
# We wish to have syntax for describing such rules, so we introduce the notation
# 
#    		p : [ J ]
# 
# to mean that p is a derivation of the judgment J.  Then we can rephrase the
# rule slightly:
# 
# 	  oT : [ T = T' ]         TT' : [ o : T ]
# 	  -------------------------------------------
# 		 tcast oT TT' : [ o : T' ]

# Note: we have to use the square brackets, because LF and TS both want to use
# the same syntax.  The square brackets indicate that TS is on the inside and
# LF is on the outside.

#        	
# The formal parameters of the rule are represented by the variables o,
# T, and T'.  We could describe the rule in linear format this way, by inserting
# such things as "PPi", "::", ",", as follows:
# 
# 	  Pi oT : [ o : T ], Pi TT' : [ T = T' ], [ o : T' ].

# or as

# 	  [ o : T ] -> [ T = T' ] -> [ o : T' ]

# 
# We decorate the rule with the name and the parameters, as follows:
# 
#        Rule tcast :: Pi { T T' : Texpr } {o : Oexpr),
# 		     Pi oT  : [ o : T  ],
# 		     Pi TT' : [ T = T' ],
# 		     o : T'.
# 
# We could also write it this way:
# 
#        Rule tcast : Pi {T T' : Texpr) {o : Oexpr), [ o : T ] -> [ T = T' ] -> [ o : T' ]
#
# Four types of judgments:
#
#			 T type
#			 o : T
#			 T = T'
#			 o = o' : T
#
#They correspond to four constructors declared in LF:
#
#     			istype T		= [ T type ]
#			hastype o T		= [ o : T ]
#			teq T T'		= [ T = T' ]
#			oeq o o' T		= [ o = o' : T ]

There are also constructors for all the terms of TS:

      	[lambda] : Texpr -> (Oexpr -> Oexpr) -> Oexpr			[lambda] T U   		lambda x:T, U
	    [ev] : Oexpr -> Oexpr -> Texpr -> Oexpr			[ev] f o T		[ev;x](f,o,T)
	    [Pi] : Texpr -> (Oexpr -> Texpr) -> Texpr			[Pi] T U		Pi x:T, U

	  Rule ev : Pi (T : Texpr) (U : Oexpr -> Texpr) (f o : Oexpr),
		     Pi m : [f : Pi x:T, U],
		     Pi n : [o : T],
		     [ f o : U[o/x]]

		     ---- oops, we have a conflict between two uses of [ ] here ---

		     Here is the LF formulation, where U o denotes the LF application.

		        hastype (<ev> f o U) (U o)


        Rule tcast : Pi (T T' : Texpr) (o : Oexpr),		# rule 13 in the paper UPTS
		     Pi oT : [o : T],		# regard oo as a stand-in for o
		     Pi TT' : [T = T'],
		     [o : T'].			# regard [tcast oT TT'] as a stand-in for the cast of oo from type T to type T'

# eta reduction for empty, on types:
    Rule tetaempty : Pi (T T' : Texpr), [a : Empty] -> [T = T'].

# eta reduction for empty, on objects:
    Rule oetaempty : Pi (T : Texpr) (a o o' : Oexpr), [a : Empty] -> [o : T] -> [o' : T] -> [o = o' : T].

       Rule Uintro : Pi (u : Ulevel), [ [U](u) : Type ].
		     or (?)
      Rule Uintro' : Pi (u : Ulevel), Texpr.				#  we abbreviate [ Uintro' u ] as [ [U](u) ].

#			Here [ Uintro u ] knows what context it's in, and [ Uintro' u ] doesn't.
#			That's analogous to [ [u](m) ] knowing what universe it's in, and [ [U](m) ] not.

       Rule uintro : Pi (u : Ulevel), [[u](u) : [U](next u)].

    Rule starintro : Pi (u : Ulevel), [ *[u](u) type ].

       Rule staru : Pi (u : Ulevel), [ *[u](u) = [U](u) ].		# add this as a reduction rule

   Rule emptytype : Pi, [ empty : [U](uuu0) ].

   Rule starempty : Pi, [ *empty = Empty ].		# add this as a reduction rule, too (left to right), in some list(s) of reduction rules

Constraint bottom0 : Pi (u : Ulevel), uuu0 <= u.	# add this "constraint" every time a new universe variable is introduced, somehow

#   Some introduction rules for things in TS:

	Rule Empty : Type.				# a constant (global variable)
	Rule empty : Object.				# a constant

	Rule uuu0 : Ulevel.				# a constant, lowest universe
	Rule next : Pi u : Ulevel, Ulevel.		# formerly [ next u ] is [ u+1 ]
	Rule max  : Pi u v : Ulevel, Ulevel.

Four types of definitions in the user language:

    Definition foo1 : Pi (u1 ... : Ulevel) (T1 ... : Type) (o1:O1) ... := T : Type .
    Definition foo2 : Pi (u1 ... : Ulevel) (T1 ... : Type) (o1:O1) ... := o : T .
    Definition foo3 : Pi (u1 ... : Ulevel) (T1 ... : Type) (o1:O1) ... := T = T' .
    Definition foo4 : Pi (u1 ... : Ulevel) (T1 ... : Type) (o1:O1) ... := o = o' : T .

And the definitions may come equipped with u-level constraints, such as u1<u2.

Let's use LF's LAMBDA to express such definitions, translating Type into Texpr, for example:

     foo1 : Pi (u1, u2; u1<u2 : Uexpr) (T : Texpr) (t : T) := *t.

will be recorded as a pair of new possible labels for nodes of TS-trees:

     [defapp;foo.0]
     [defapp;foo.1]

and with values and type families as follows:

     Definition foo1.0 := LAMBDA u1, LAMBDA u2, LAMBDA T, LAMBDA t, [El](t)
     Definition foo1.0 :  Pi u1:Uexpr, Pi u2:Uexpr, Pi T:Texpr, Pi t:Oexpr, Texpr

     Definition foo1.1 := ?42
     Definition foo1.1 :  Pi u1:Uexpr, Pi u2:Uexpr, Pi T:Texpr, Pi t:Oexpr, Pi _:(Istype T), Pi _:(Hastype t T), Istype [El](t) .
     	or
     Definition foo1.1 :  Pi u1:Uexpr, Pi u2:Uexpr, Pi T:Texpr, Pi t:Oexpr, Pi _:(Istype T), Pi _:(Hastype t T), Istype (foo1.0 u1 u2 T t).

If we encounter an application of foo1 in a TS-term, such as

      foo1.1 u v X x

we store an eta-long LF-application of foo1.1 with holes for the judgments:

      ([defapp;foo1.1] u v X x _ _)

, i.e., we make the judgment arguments optional.

=============================================================================

We need a parser for LF expressions.

   The TS-expression parser translates, for example,

   	lambda f:T->U, lambda o:T, [ev;_](f,o,U)

   into 

   	([lambda] 
		 ([Pi] T 
		       (LAMBDA _ : Obj, U))
		 (LAMBDA f : Obj, 
		 	 ([lambda] T 
			 	   (LAMBDA o : Obj, 
				   	   ([ev] f o 
					   	 (LAMBDA _ : Obj, U))))))

and the LF-parser should accept that input, producing the same result.

Then we could write the inference rules in LF form.
